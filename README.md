The Realtime Weather Application is a web-based tool that allows users to search for and display the current weather information for any city. The application fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI and 
displays the city's name, local time, and temperature.

How It Works

1.User Input: The user enters the city name in the input field and clicks the "Search" button.
2.Fetch Data: The application makes an API call to the WeatherAPI with the provided city name.
3.Display Data: The application updates the displayed city name, local time, and temperature based on the retrieved data.
